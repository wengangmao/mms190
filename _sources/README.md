**Chalmers MPMOB maste course: Method for reliability and risk analysis**

## Eligibility
General entry requirements for Master's level (second cycle)
Applicants enrolled in a programme at Chalmers where the course is included in the study programme are exempted from fulfilling the requirements above.
Specific entry requirements
English 6 (or by other approved means with the equivalent proficiency level)
Applicants enrolled in a programme at Chalmers where the course is included in the study programme are exempted from fulfilling the requirements above.
Course specific prerequisites
Mathematics (including mathematical statistics, numerical analysis and multi-variable calculus), mechanics and strength of materials and engineering materials

## Aim
The course gives the student knowledge and tools how to design marine structures with regard to limit state based approaches by means of probability and risk analysis approaches. A variety of simplistic and advanced methodologies are compared with objective to demonstrate their advantages and limitations. Realistic and typical examples for marine structures are used throughout the course in order to introduce the student to real examples with their challenges of complexity which require solid and well-motivated assumptions.

## Learning outcomes (after completion of the course the student should be able to)
After finishing the course, students will have good knowledge and understanding of how to carry out risk and reliability analysis of mechanical systems. More specifically, the student should be able to:
- use and interpret design rules and standards in order to analyze risk and reliability levels according to given design criteria and safety measures,
- carry out reliability analysis for specific mechanical system components,
- demonstrate which is the most appropriate methodology to use in a risk and reliability analysis for certain practical engineering problems with respect to mechanical system safety,
- understand and discuss the advantages and limitations using FORM, SORM and other simulation method for reliability analysis,
- and critically evaluate and compare various design concepts with respect to reliability and safety of engineering systems.
